<h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>  Ascended Woman is my ‘stage name’ formulated from a Tarot reading after pulling the reversed Hanged Man. It seemed to fit in a way where I was enlightened to share my path, to help others along the difficult journey that we call life. Ascension is something a lot of us try to achieve in one way or another. To be above everyone else.</p>

  <blockquote><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> I don’t pretend to be some know it all guru who has all the answers <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></blockquote>

  <p>I want to create a world where we value kindness and compassion above all else. Where we forgive more than we judge. Where we love not fight. I know realistically this isn’t going to happen. But a girl can dream right? I know suffering is going to happen regardless, it can’t not. What I want, is people who are suffering to feel valued, appreciated and less misunderstood. Less alone.</p>

  <p>I’ve always enjoyed writing. It’s something that feels very natural. Yet at the same time I’ve always been too secretive to share because I’ve never believed I was good enough, or made sense! But now, although I still care, I’ve reached a point where I’m just like why not? If just one person understands me and is in someway helped by what I have to say, that’s all I need.</p>
